This repository contains coding part of assignments and the final project which I was responsible for

- Description:
- A1:
  - split train, validation and test data
  - selected decision tree models with different split criteria based accuracy of prediction
  - visualized the decision tree with best performance
  - computed information gain of each features in top splits

- A2
  - implemented kNN
  - implemented logistic regression with gradient descent, evaluated with cross entropy and accuracy
  - implemented Locally Weighted Regression

- A3
  - fitted Naive Bayes using MLE and MAP, compute log likelihood for each training data point
  - fitted a set of 10 class-conditional Gaussians with a separate, each with its own full covariance matrix.


- Final Project
  - Implemented kNN-based imputation
  - bootstrapped sample and create different decision trees on each sample, combined predictions by major vote to get the ensemble model prediction
  - improved the ensemble model by adding new features
  - added additional features dynamically depending on the characteristics of the bootstrapped samples and applied PCA for dimensionality reduction in this case
